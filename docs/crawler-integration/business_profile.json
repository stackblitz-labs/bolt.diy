The atmosphere feels warm and welcoming, perfect for a casual meal or when you’re craving true comfort food with great quality.\n\nThe food is outstanding. Their beef curry is incredibly flavorful — rich, tender, and deeply satisfying. I was also surprised by how good the burger was; juicy, well-seasoned, and way better than you’d expect from a ramen shop. Everything here is cooked with care and you can taste the quality in every bite.\n\nService is another highlight. The staff are friendly, attentive, and genuinely make you feel at home without being intrusive. It’s the kind of place where you feel taken care of.\n\nIf you’re looking for great comfort food, excellent quality, and a cozy atmosphere, Kuu Ramen is definitely worth a visit. Highly recommended!",

The red stuff, I think it’s something pickled, is amazing.\n\nThis place has a sister location in Fidi I believe. That one is busier than I’ve seen this one during the work week.
