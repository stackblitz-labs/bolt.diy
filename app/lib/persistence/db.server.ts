/**
 * Server-side Database Functions
 *
 * This file previously contained client-side HTTP functions that were mistakenly
 * placed here. Those functions have been moved to db.ts since they use fetch()
 * and are client-side code.
 *
 * This file is kept as a placeholder in case true server-only functions
 * are needed in the future.
